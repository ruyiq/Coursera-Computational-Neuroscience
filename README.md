# Coursera-Computational-Neuroscience

## About This Course
This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function. Specific topics that will be covered include representation of information by spiking neurons, processing of information in neural networks, and algorithms for adaptation and learning. We will make use of Matlab/Octave/Python demonstrations and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course.
